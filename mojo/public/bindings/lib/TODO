 - Specify object packing and padding.
 - Add compile-time asserts to verify object packing and padding.
 - Pack boolean arrays?
 - Get rid of gratuitous use of Align() function in favor of adding padding.
 - Investigate making arrays of objects not be arrays of pointers.
 - Consider getting rid of Data structs (i.e., d_ member).
