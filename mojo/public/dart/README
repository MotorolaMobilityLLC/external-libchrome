These are interim instructions for building and testing Dart's Mojo bindings.
These instructions currently only work for Linux, and assume you already have a
Mojo checkout.

1.) Add a Dart VM source checkout to your client:

  Edit your .gclient file. Replace "DEPS" with "DEPS.dart".
  Then, run:

    $ gclient sync

  You should now have a directory //dart


2.) Configure Mojo with Dart.

  $ ./mojo/tools/mojob.py gn --release --with-dart


3.) Build Mojo with Dart.

  $ ./mojo/tools/mojob.py build --release


4.) Run Dart tests.

  $ ./mojo/tools/mojob.py darttest --release
