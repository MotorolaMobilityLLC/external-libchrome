// |RawChannel| is an interface to objects that wrap an OS "pipe". It presents
// the following interface to users:
//  - Receives and dispatches messages on an I/O thread (running a
//    |MessageLoopForIO|.
//  - Provides a thread-safe way of writing messages (|WriteMessage()|);
//    writing/queueing messages will not block and is atomic from the point of
//    view of the caller. If necessary, messages are queued (to be written on
//    the aforementioned thread).
//
// OS-specific implementation subclasses are to be instantiated using the
// |Create()| static factory method.
//
// With the exception of |WriteMessage()|, this class is thread-unsafe (and in
// general its methods should only be used on the I/O thread, i.e., the thread
// on which |Init()| is called).
