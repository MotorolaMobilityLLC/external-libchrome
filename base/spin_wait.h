// This file provides a macro ONLY for use in testing.
// DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION CODE.  There are much better ways to wait.

// This code is very helpful in testing multi-threaded code, without depending
// on almost any primitives.  This is especially helpful if you are testing
// those primitive multi-threaded constructs.

// We provide a simple one argument spin wait (for 1 second), and a generic
// spin wait (for longer periods of time).

// Provide a macro that will wait no longer than 1 second for an asynchronous
// change is the value of an expression.
// A typical use would be:
//
//   SPIN_FOR_1_SECOND_OR_UNTIL_TRUE(0 == f(x));
//
// The expression will be evaluated repeatedly until it is true, or until
// the time (1 second) expires.
// Since tests generally have a 5 second watch dog timer, this spin loop is
// typically used to get the padding needed on a given test platform to assure
// that the test passes, even if load varies, and external events vary.
