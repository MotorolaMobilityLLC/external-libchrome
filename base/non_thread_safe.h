// A helper class used to help verify that methods of a class are
// called from the same thread.  One can inherit from this class and use
// CalledOnValidThread() to verify.
//
// This is intended to be used with classes that appear to be thread safe, but
// aren't.  For example, a service or a singleton like the preferences system.
//
// Example:
// class MyClass : public NonThreadSafe {
//  public:
//   void Foo() {
//     DCHECK(CalledOnValidThread());
//     ... (do stuff) ...
//   }
// }
//
// In Release mode, CalledOnValidThread will always return true.
