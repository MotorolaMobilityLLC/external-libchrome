// This class provides a facility similar to the CRT atexit(), except that
// we control when the callbacks are executed. Under Windows for a DLL they
// happen at a really bad time and under the loader lock. This facility is
// mostly used by base::Singleton.

// The usage is simple. Early in the main() or WinMain() scope create an
// AtExitManager object on the stack:
// int main(...) {
//    base::AtExitManager exit_manager;
//   
// }
// When the exit_manager object goes out of scope, all the registered
// callbacks and singleton destructors will be called.
