// FieldTrial is a class for handling details of statistical experiments
// performed by actual users in the field (i.e., in a shipped or beta product).
// All code is called exclusively on the UI thread currently.
//
// The simplest example is a test to see whether one of two options produces
// "better" results across our user population.  In that scenario, UMA data
// is uploaded to show the test results, and this class manages the state of
// each such test (state == which option was pseudo-randomly selected).
// States are typically generated randomly, either based on a one time
// randomization (reused during each run of the program), or by a startup
// randomization (keeping that tests state constant across a run), or by
// continuous randomization across a run.
// Only startup randomization is implemented (thus far).
