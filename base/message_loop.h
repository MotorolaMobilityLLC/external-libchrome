// A MessageLoop is used to process events for a particular thread.
// There is at most one MessageLoop instance per thread.
// Events include Windows Message Queue messages, Tasks submitted to PostTask
// or managed by TimerManager, APC calls (as time permits), and signals sent to
// a registered set of HANDLES.
// Processing events corresponds (respectively) to dispatching Windows messages,
// running Tasks, yielding time to APCs, and calling Watchers when the
// corresponding HANDLE is signaled.

//
// NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, a MessageLoop's methods may only be called
// on the thread where the MessageLoop's Run method executes.
//
// WARNING: MessageLoop has task reentrancy protection. This means that if a
// task is being processed, a second task cannot start until the first task is
// finished. Reentrancy can happen when processing a task, and an inner message
// pump is created.  That inner pump then processes windows messages which could
// implicitly start an inner task. Inner messages pumps are created with dialogs
// (DialogBox), common dialogs (GetOpenFileName), OLE functions (DoDragDrop),
// printer functions (StartDoc) and *many* others.
// Sample workaround when inner task processing is needed:
//   bool old_state = MessageLoop::current()->NestableTasksAllowed();
//   MessageLoop::current()->SetNestableTasksAllowed(true);
//   HRESULT hr = DoDragDrop(...); // Implicitly runs a modal message loop here.
//   MessageLoop::current()->SetNestableTasksAllowed(old_state);
//   // Process hr  (the result returned by DoDragDrop().
//
// Please be **SURE** your task is reentrant and all global variables are stable
// and accessible before calling SetNestableTasksAllowed(true).
//

// Message loop has several distinct functions.  It provides message pumps,
// responds to windows message dispatches, manipulates queues of Tasks.
// The most central operation is the implementation of message pumps, along with
// several subtleties.

// MessageLoop currently implements several different message pumps.  A message
// pump is (traditionally) something that reads from an incoming queue, and then
// dispatches the work.
//
// The first message pump, RunTraditional(), is among other things a
// traditional Windows Message pump.  It contains a nearly infinite loop that
// peeks out messages, and then dispatches them.
// Intermixed with those peeks are checks on a queue of Tasks, checks for
// signaled objects, and checks to see if TimerManager has tasks to run.
// When there are no events to be serviced, this pump goes into a wait state.
// For 99.99% of all events, this first message pump handles all processing.
//
// When a task, or windows event, invokes on the stack a native dialog box or
// such, that window typically provides a bare bones (native?) message pump.
// That bare-bones message pump generally supports little more than a peek of
// the Windows message queue, followed by a dispatch of the peeked message.
// MessageLoop extends that bare-bones message pump to also service Tasks, at
// the cost of some complexity.
// The basic structure of the extension (refered to as a sub-pump) is that a
// special message,kMsgPumpATask, is repeatedly injected into the Windows
// Message queue. Each time the kMsgPumpATask message is peeked, checks are made
// for an extended set of events, including the availability of Tasks to run.
//
// After running a task, the special message kMsgPumpATask is again posted to
// the Windows Message queue, ensuring a future time slice for processing a
// future event.
//
// To prevent flooding the Windows Message queue, care is taken to be sure that
// at most one kMsgPumpATask message is EVER pending in the Winow's Message
// queue.
//
// There are a few additional complexities in this system where, when there are
// no Tasks to run, this otherwise infinite stream of messages which drives the
// sub-pump is halted.  The pump is automatically re-started when Tasks are
// queued.
//
// A second complexity is that the presence of this stream of posted tasks may
// prevent a bare-bones message pump from ever peeking a WM_PAINT or WM_TIMER.
// Such paint and timer events always give priority to a posted message, such as
// kMsgPumpATask messages.  As a result, care is taken to do some peeking in
// between the posting of each kMsgPumpATask message (i.e., after kMsgPumpATask
// is peeked, and before a replacement kMsgPumpATask is posted).
//
//
// NOTE: Although it may seem odd that messages are used to start and stop this
// flow (as opposed to signaling objects, etc.), it should be understood that
// the native message pump will *only* respond to messages.  As a result, it is
// an excellent choice.  It is also helpful that the starter messages that are
// placed in the queue when new task arrive also awakens the RunTraditional()
// loop.
